## Investing in Your Technical Futures

> CSSE 1,2 prepares students for the AP Computer Science pathway. This course focuses on teaching the JavaScript programming language, object-oriented programming and inheritance, and developing algorithmic thinking skills. Through game development projects, students will engage in engineering skills, learn fundamentals of programming, work with data structures, and foster collaboration skills with their peers. Tech talks will be conducted by teachers to introduce concepts, provide guidance on tools, and support ideas to establish development requirements. By performing development and exploration, this course aims to raise students' awareness of the tremendous capabilities of computers and software engineering skills across various fields.
